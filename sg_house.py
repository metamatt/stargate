# A note on object instantiation:
# - toplevel framework instantiates a single StargateHouse instance
# - StargateHouse instantiates gateway plugins (StargateGateway instances)
# - each gateway plugin creates 0 or more device instances, which are StargateDevice subclasses
# - the gateway plugin is responsible for mapping the device instances it creates to StargateArea instances
#   (existing, or created on the fly) by asking the house to do so
# - thus, StargateHouse creates StargateArea instances during gateway initialization
