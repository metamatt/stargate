# Control of DSC PowerSeries system.
#
# This module handles providing additional TCP connections to the DSC panel's integration
# interface, by chaining through the one we control (since the Envisalink 2DS allows only
# one client at a time).
#
# Terminology note: 'cmdline' variable holds encoded command with checksum but no CRLF terminator
#
# BUGS:
# - reflector is largely untested
