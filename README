Currently: testing web interface to Lutron RadioRa2 lighting control system.

To become: web/API interface to various home automation gateways, including
- Lutron RadioRa2 lighting/windowshade/hvac control system
- DSC PowerSeries security system (via Envisalink ethernet integration interface)
- MiCasaVerde Vera z-wave gateway and home controller
- and maybe more

My goal is to wrap these things in a usable REST API, provide a simple web
UI that is more consistent than the various builtin ones, and provide various
higher-level functions like device usage/adjustment history and cross-gateway
task automation.
