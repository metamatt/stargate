# This module handles the RadioRa2 project layout (from the configuration
# software, and available from the repeater's web server as DbXmlInfo.xml),
# and provides a high-level interface for working with its information in
# a structured way: areas, loads, and keypads.
#
# The idea here is that RaLayout and friends model things very close to
# the way Lutron's XML file does. Then RaHouse can reinterpret and model
# things differently if it so chooses.
