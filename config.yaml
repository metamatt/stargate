# Configuration file for Stargate (https://github.com/metamatt/stargate).
# Data is in YAML format (http://www.yaml.org/; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
#
# Stargate takes an explicit-configuration approach: values listed here as "default"
# are default only because this file specifies them by default, and must remain
# in this file; the code won't know what to do without them.

    # have not changed state, in seconds; default 3600 (1 hour)
