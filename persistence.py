# Control of Lutron RadioRa2 system and friends.
#
# Persistence module for tracking device state changes, history, statistics.
# Implemented atop SQLite3.
#
# Goal is to be able to provide data in forms like:
# _light_ _x_ is _on_ for _45 minutes_, _5_ changes today, on for _2 hours_ with an average level of _50%_.
# _door_ _x_ is _closed_ since _45 minutes_, _5_ changes today, open for _5 hours_ and closed for _12 hours).
# _device_ _name_ is _state_ since _changetime_, _numchanges_ in _timebucket_, _interesting_state_ for _time_in_state_ ...
#
# Bugs/work items:
# - not tracking average level while on yet (and might need more parameters/persisted fields to do so)
# - should cap the amount of data we store, and aggregate into less granular buckets
#
# A note on timekeeping: we write an event whenever a device changes state, and assuming we were running and watching
# the whole time, we know what state that device was in for the entire interval between the previous and current events
# for that device. However, if we crash or get killed or lose the connection to a device's gateway, we won't be able to
# track it until we restart. To represent this, there are two additional event types: "checkpoint" (meaning nothing's
# changed since the last event) and "startup" (meaning we don't know what happened since the last event). An interval
# ending in a startup event is mapped to unknown state for that device, and checkpoints establish an upper bound on how
# long such intervals can be.
